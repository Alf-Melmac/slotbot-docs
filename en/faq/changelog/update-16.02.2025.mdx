## üêû Bug Fixes

* Error message after importing a mission.sqm. `(Thanks GSG9_abzocker for pointing that out)` _(commit: [b947baaf](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/b947baafe2661cdcddd7d19a75145e09b814fe71))_

* Improvements to the storage of changes in the slot list of an event.
