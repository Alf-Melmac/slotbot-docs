## 🐞 Bug Fixes

* When editing the slot list, not all participants who have already been entered are deleted. `(Thanks to P4nd4 for reporting this)`. In addition, multiple squads or slots can be added again. _(commit: [80c42f05](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/80c42f050adfd14de8873e3f359c790edfd6d7db))_
