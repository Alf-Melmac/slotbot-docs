## 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Too many unassigned events in the future will no longer prevent assignment in Discord channels via /[add_event_to_channel](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/add-event-to-cannel). *(commit:* [*ae50ca1c*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/ae50ca1c77eed9699c19b54b560b1304d923835f)*)*
