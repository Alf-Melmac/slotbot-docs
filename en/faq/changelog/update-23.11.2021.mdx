* The Arma mission upload (see [Arma 3 Slotlist generation](/en/events/creating-events/arma-3-slotlist-generation)) is now also possible while editing an empty event.
* The DAA standard fields now map the [new scheduling](https://wiki.deutsche-arma-allianz.de/organisation/missionen#zeitplan). *(commit:* [*83a8f779*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/83a8f779e0205ca9bce54f55242ffbefb1d9d7ac)*)*
* Better use of Discord slotlist messages. Now not only groups but slots are separated directly and some unnecessary paragraphs and spaces are omitted. *(commit:* [*547a0b21*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/547a0b2139aa0e169f5179ac7f402c4ccb2dd89b)*)*

## üêû Bug Fixes

* The blocking of occupied slots looked like it could be changed during event editing. *(commit:* [*e4330ec2*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e4330ec214588835027b6dc406f0a8d4c0a72432)*)*
* The favicons of the pages "Not found" (404) and "Not allowed" (403) could not be found. *(commit:* [*61659546*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/616595460ba4b65d0c7fdd1c54142bac6519314e)*)*
* The mission.sqm upload failed if the file exceeded 1MB. This limit has been raised to 2MB.
