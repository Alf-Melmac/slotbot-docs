## ‚≠ê New Features

* The format of an event image URL is now validated directly on entry. *(commit:* [*9f09f8ca*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/9f09f8ca4e4a3ada7bf8223ce888b452bdca7c4b)*,* [*0fc2c9e7*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/0fc2c9e7cdf1f22687f1d52d4453f26aad609991)*)*
* All pages display information faster during navigation to other pages, because static elements, such as the header, are no longer reloaded. These static elements are also no longer hidden for a short time during loading, but remain visible. Navigation feels much smoother as a result. *(commit:* [*71aae4af*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/71aae4afe2d05f118eb39aa4f8386f3ef8492f61)*)*
* The community pages can handle unexpected errors much better and show the specific problem. In addition, the loading process is visibly displayed. *(commit:* [*71aae4af*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/71aae4afe2d05f118eb39aa4f8386f3ef8492f61)*)*
* Many event changes, especially to the slot list, will be reflected more quickly in the Discord output in the future. *(commit:* [*1750d9fe*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/1750d9fe6f3dca862ee244f4b265a14ba251cc1d)*)*
* All API endpoints have been revised and cleanly modeled. The objects and error message now contain all relevant information and fewer spelling errors. The documentation is now available here: [API documentation](/en/integrations/api-documentation). *(commit:* [*a797c7a4*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/a797c7a4c184cccc05706dceaf783a2e00a93b7e)*,* [*4a30ca60*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/4a30ca60d6a888767f846408291dd473b9a4a8ab)*)*

## üêû Bug Fixes

* Event notifications are sent again and at the right time. `(Thanks M√§xo for letting me know)` *(commit:* [*9742b822*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/9742b8229f8b1ef61849f868301b1dbf6343b092)*)*
* Previously blocked slots no longer retain the old blocking text if a new one is not specified. Instead, the default fallback ("Gesperrt") is used. *(commit:* [*06cc9d1e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/06cc9d1e24bd6be7cf1882b63ecb38357a320252)*)*

## üî® Technical

* Support for the [new Discord usernames](https://discord.com/blog/usernames). *(commit:* [*7f6fbc6e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/7f6fbc6e507bf0a55b542809da7e3464a77142ff)*)*
* The scope of the `JSESSIONID` cookie that is generated at login has been restricted. This provides a bit more protection against CSRF attacks. *(commit:* [*2b48202b*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/2b48202b2c37effc2f122a22079fc4bdb62a0041)*)*
