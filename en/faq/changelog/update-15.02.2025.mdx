## ‚≠ê New Features

* The event details show the user why it is not possible to register for a slot. Reasons for this may include lack of community membership for reserved places, exclusion from a community, or lack of requirements due to the settings in the feature preview. _(commit: [5ea09384](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/5ea0938463838d514e23a6d3c025fa75a479c0ba), [#118](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/pull/118))_

* Happy New Year! üéâ _(commit: [59951b1b](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/59951b1bac31f572f6ebfc8cb08e2855dce1ee00))_

* Custom styling for GTO. _(commit: [180a382d](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/180a382d4075efe7dc78ef2dc6fd102b6ea1ade5))_

* Reservations for the groups now always display the name in a tooltip, even if the community has its own logo. _(commit: [a6652996](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/a6652996e220247dae7c628b4c8e14b224256fbd))_

* By moving the community administration to its own page ([Update 09.12.2024](/en/faq/changelog/update-09.12.2024)), the member overview can take up more vertical space. _(commit: [912d38ac](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/912d38ac86b1b6a995253b290dc7d2a732f4f904))_

## üêû Bug Fixes

* Reservists no longer advance to slots that are not available to them. The [/random_slot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/random-slot) command now also only selects available slots. _(commit: [50fec8c6](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/50fec8c692de827391a955f512db6f74e67e6b3e))_

* If a user was banned from a community, they could no longer join any other community. _(commit: [edd0e7d1](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/edd0e7d1a7ddbb869ff63bd2a93c0e4646037385))_

## üîÆ Feature Preview

* The experiment with extended information on requirements (detailed requirement list) has been discontinued. The additional information does not provide any meaningful added value and overloads the settings of the available requirements for event details. _(commit: [8aa54296](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/8aa54296391763434d024383a61ff09374f6d8da), [15418573](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/154185735cf8382992e9d71e374f28412ec8b4f8))_

* Requirements for the entire event, individual squads and slots. The requirements for a slot are built up additively via the hierarchy. To participate, all conditions of the slot + squad + event must therefore be met. _(commit: [d0c255dd](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/d0c255dd5f56e81d2de93c2a1a49a806d268c26a), [705bee40](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/705bee402ef4fbae1116107035db68c47c6f5ca8), [6853e191](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/6853e191249d88a85ca8d829552bcff054a30f3d), [403e79c0](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/403e79c085375dbee78ef182c7876641fb295d7b))_

* Display of requirements for the event, squad and slot. _(commit: [a6652996](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/a6652996e220247dae7c628b4c8e14b224256fbd), [1ecaef35](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/1ecaef35c7c6ddbd91edf8ddd49f5da7431e3c99), [60bf9f83](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/60bf9f83d172130f89b67d3c63dc13dbf948286e))_

* Participants can mark requirements that they do not yet meet and for which self-assignment is permitted as fulfilled for themselves via the event details. After that, they will no longer be notified that they do not meet the requirement for other events. _(commit: [9f483ac0](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/9f483ac0232d4b4dc4c184ee7764428a0c77ec9c), [497f106a](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/497f106affabaaa1ad437a5ee458aaa9ff65fda6))_

* Community administrators have been given the option to manage the fulfilment of requirements without permitted self-assignment for members in their community's member overview. _(commit: [dd5f1a4c](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/dd5f1a4c6068d521ee41e467ecd20dee76a129c5), [baecd936](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/baecd9366844cb58706c44c851e144c3954e79be))_

* In the management of available requirements, in addition to the names and authorisation for self-assignment, the obligation and images for the individual requirements can now also be configured. _(commit: [f438dd6a](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/f438dd6aa3e4f68fde23f871b919d32f6ff3253e))_

* Explanation of rejected slot attempts. _(commit: [50fec8c6](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/50fec8c692de827391a955f512db6f74e67e6b3e))_

* When a member leaves a community, all fullfilled requirements for that community are automatically deleted. _(commit: [1cd9a07b](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/1cd9a07b3fb965e632ba5b58be2bae7d9aaf4a91))_

## üî® Technical

* Performance improvements in the member overview.

  * Where previously a separate ban dialogue was created for each member, there is now only one, which is also reused for managing the requirements. _(commit: [dd5f1a4c](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/dd5f1a4c6068d521ee41e467ecd20dee76a129c5))_

  * All administrative actions for members are now only downloaded by administrators, which optimises initial access to the site for everyone else. _(commit: [6a72c48f](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/6a72c48f4e29d7f80fa450a83870bc828728ed67))_
