## ‚≠ê New Features

* Improved configuration of the [event archive](/en/integrations/discord/archive). This can now be set by the `Slotbot_Event_Manage`rs in the community settings. If this channel is deleted, the configuration will be undone. *(commit:* [*c8a9b312*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/c8a9b312d0dbecc74b5eabae33542d00c36c60ce)*,* [*290e55ec*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/290e55ecf2609d5dbebd7468392962e2d999506e)*)*
* If the Discord bot is not yet a member of the server, the invitation is offered in the community settings. Before that, it is not possible to make Discord-specific configurations. *(commit:* [*c8a9b312*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/c8a9b312d0dbecc74b5eabae33542d00c36c60ce)*)*
* Event links to discord channels will now be removed automatically when the bot is removed from a server. *(commit:* [*7d180d40*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/7d180d4010849ff2d09aeee7fffb6659c640787b)*)*
* The /archive command is no longer available. If an archive channel is configured and the event channel is deleted, the events are automatically archived. *(commit:* [*e99933ee*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e99933ee24c3c221e1c056b7c2af01f7023079fe)*)*
* Event List API endpoint. The new endpoint allows you to find all events in a given time period. See [api documentation](/en/integrations/api-documentation). *(commit:* [*e148f9ab*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e148f9ab35dc39a7ce10e5e9773518e6dfbe0af8)*)*

## üêû Bug Fixes

* Discord interactions (slash commands and context menu) will now also be created if the bot subsequently joins a server without restarting. This also speeds up the restart. *(commit:* [*7d180d40*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/7d180d4010849ff2d09aeee7fffb6659c640787b)*)*
* The checkbox that is shown for interactions that are not directly visible will be shown again as a real check mark. *(commit:* [*0e5e59a2*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/0e5e59a2dee74f62e4bf79a1691f091790828a7d)*)*
