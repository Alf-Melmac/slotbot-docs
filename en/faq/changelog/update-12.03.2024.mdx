## ‚≠ê New Features

* Major updates in the component library also have a big impact *(*[*#426*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/pull/426)*)*
* In my non-representative test, the TTT calendar was accelerated by 50% (500ms vs. 1 Sekunde) and the community overview by three times as much (180ms vs. 560ms). The required download size has also been almost halved.
* All sizes are now relative to the font size set in the browser.
* Many spacings and colours have been adjusted to improve clarity and visibility. Especially in mobile use, information is given the space it needs.
* Event types can now also be created while an event is being edited.
* By default, the username of the currently logged in user is inserted when an event is created. *(commit:* [*c8ffc4c2*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/c8ffc4c2a762fcec7373b7c974b1a7e20001f12e)*)*
* Text formatting can now be escaped with backslashes as in Discord. ([#70](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/pull/70)) by [*@TheConen*](https://github.com/TheConen), [@Alf-Melmac](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac)
