# Update 03.08.2021

## üóíÔ∏è Noteworthy

* The permissions are now decoupled from the existing roles (e.g. creator and moderator). The bot automatically creates the required roles at the start, if they do not already exist. These will control the permissions in the future. These roles should not be renamed or deleted. _(commit:_ [_4b436905_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/4b4369058565c3dcb3cebcd243fb04c7cbba492d)_)_

## ‚≠ê New Features

* Added more **slash commands**. The commands PostMessage, EventPing, RandomSlot, Swap, AddEventToChannel can now be used via the new [slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ). Start the message with a <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/slash-emoji.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and Discord will do the explanation and validation as you type. _(commit:_ [_446a9c58_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/446a9c586ae3c1a4330b38a85e2be5a4eddf7f84)_,_ [_f94607bd_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/f94607bd0f760a35ef9f8cebe05325f2e1514c3e)_,_ [_f476c0d3_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/f476c0d3af967cfaf64e58f11086525e2e94ced6)_,_ [_7b790452_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/7b7904521567b60e4cdbe7cb86a481f182b218a5)_)_
