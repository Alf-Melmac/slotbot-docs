## ‚≠ê New Features

* [unslot-erzwingen.md](../../integrations/discord/bot-befehle/unslot-erzwingen.md "mention") has been enhanced and is now able to identify people by their name as well as their slot number. _(commit:_ [_60b68d71_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/60b68d7100c85c7c9ba53ea47943d52f3cc7918d)_)_

* The commands for quickly managing the slot list in Discord have been reworked. They are now available as slash commands: [rename-slot.md](../../integrations/discord/bot-befehle/rename-slot.md "mention") _(commit:_ [_f367d5c1_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/f367d5c1eb03edf903674c0d7ae6892684029979)_,_ [_e69d341c_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e69d341c98a5596589341931b5f897a5f04efb01)_)_, [rename-squad.md](../../integrations/discord/bot-befehle/rename-squad.md "mention") _(commit:_ [_443d03fb_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/443d03fb4da31648da66667b3529f2f3c325d9a3)_)_, [add-slot.md](../../integrations/discord/bot-befehle/add-slot.md "mention") _(commit:_ [_b03f4eab_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/b03f4eab89db410ad2ecf4cd449234d16d15e770)_)_, [delete-slot.md](../../integrations/discord/bot-befehle/delete-slot.md "mention") _(commit:_ [_39d2394c_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/39d2394c82180c54428bcd5d33e299f868fbd787)_)_. For all of them, the user now receives better described, translated error messages and a faster response time.
  * The `EditMessage` and `SteamId` commands have been removed. Messages can no longer be sent through the botfor a while, and the SteamId can be changed on the website [in your own profile](https://slotbot.de/profile/me). _(commit:_ [_6fd02039_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/6fd02039abecc901d43d321e1dd88080fc558e52)_)_

  * Requests are remembered across reboots and can still be processed afterwards.
  * Active notification when it is not possible to send a private message to the participant.
  * Instead of a thumbs up and thumbs down, you can now respond to requests with clearly labelled buttons.
* Event updates will be sent to Discord 5 seconds after the last change. This results in less frequent rate limiting from Discord due to more collected actions. _(commit:_ [_09e82a53_](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/09e82a532bd1126227bdd929aa7eb2f1ff23713c)_)_
