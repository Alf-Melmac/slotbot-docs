## Highlights of the update 14 November 2021

#### <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/slash-emoji.png" alt="" data-size="line">³

More slash commands. More for mission creators.

#### 📱

Unfortunately, Discord's slash commands are not really fully developed. Therefore, texts that were not sent as slash commands but begin with a "/" are nevertheless processed by the bot and attempted to be interpreted.

## Highlights of the update 9 September 2021

#### 🔔

Never miss an event again! Configure notifications in the new profile and be reminded before the start of the next event.

## Highlights of the update 3 August 2021

#### <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/slash-emoji.png" alt="" data-size="line">²

Slash commands are simple, great and top-notch. That's why there are now many more supported commands!

#### 🤫

_No more notifications for slot changes within the reserve._ The bot only sends notifications when I really get going.

## Highlights of the update 28 July 2021

#### <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/slash-emoji.png" alt="" data-size="line">

The **slash commands** are here! Discord now actively supports the use of the commands. Write a slash in the chat and let us explain the rest. All available slash commands are highlighted in the command overview.

## Highlights of the update 13 July 2021

#### 🧮

**Larger events**. A slot list twice as large is made possible. Finally, Teshaz missions fit into the Discord!

#### 🕰️

Event times are now displayed in Discord in your set time zone. No more time calculation necessary.

## Highlights of the update 12 June 2021

#### 🏃💨

**Faster event creation**. Events can be duplicated to create similar or consecutive missions with just a few clicks. During event creation, the in-game slot description can be uploaded to generate the slot list.

#### 🔒

Slots can be blocked directly from the web interface. No more spamming in the event thread after the creation of the event.

#### 👥

Even though it is not yet used in countries with the GDPR, Google's new misdeed FLoC has been deactivated. Nobody is still being tracked on our pages. If you want to read more about FLoC and why it's a bad idea, you can read about it [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea), for example.

## Highlights of the update 17 May 2021

#### 📆

Now clicking on the calendar also brings something. The date clicked on is automatically transferred to the event wizard.

#### ⚔️

Support for the Global Mobilisation and Vietnam DLCs. Shorter modpack links always look better.

## Highlights of the update 14 May 2021

#### 🧾

Events are now less Arma-dependent. This allows us to **present events** more **clearly** in general and to package information from external events without long messages!

#### 🎨

**More colours!** Finally, the uniform blue on the website and the motley mix in Discord is history. Now the colours have meaning and highlight event types.

#### 🎰

**Random Slot**. You don't know which slot to choose again? Just let the bot do it, it will pick one for you.
