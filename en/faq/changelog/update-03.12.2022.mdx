## 🐞 Bug Fixes

* Event details with a checkbox default, e.g. respawn in an Arma 3 event, prevented the event details from being created or edited if the checkbox field was visible. `(Thanks Shiro for the report)`*(commit:* [*da7bf448*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/da7bf4485175045d546bb02b1f53f0eb016fecb9)*)*
