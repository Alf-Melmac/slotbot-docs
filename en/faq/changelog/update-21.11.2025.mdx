* The calendar also displays the name of the event type, not just the color. _(commit: [e80e7e51](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/e80e7e519bd9762b1ee3fef35013f4928719401f), [eaf5c096](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/eaf5c09641fc43791b9e98d05f8ecf0d3565875d))_

	* you now see a drop indicator when dragging blocks or images, so it is clear where content will land.
	* the currently selected image receives a subtle outline.
	* focusing an image no longer offers text-highlighting controls.
* In the event details, event planners can see when participants slotted, unslotted and swapped slots with each other. This information is also available for past events. _(commit: [f4927bbb](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/f4927bbbfcdebe61900798fbd6e852bd7211db45))_

* When an error occurred, two calendars were visible. One had skeletons and the other was empty. _(commit: [e80e7e51](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/e80e7e519bd9762b1ee3fef35013f4928719401f))_
