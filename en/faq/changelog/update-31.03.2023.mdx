## ‚≠ê New Features

* The member view of individual communities loads much faster due to caching and loading on scroll. *(commit:* [*732a0837*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/732a0837a9730daecb82f7f536ae6af567a3b7bb)*,* [*f139d7ce*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/f139d7cef90cca341480bf7f53704f0b7a78e3af)*)*
* Each date and time is automatically converted to the viewer's time zone. Entries are also converted directly and displayed for each viewer in their own time zone. *(commit:* [*d1e5c9db*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/d1e5c9db1811bd97004636541e819a098ccad740)*,* [*470deda4*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/470deda4e8e951863ba0171208272ae5924be205)*,* [*e4ea5b6d*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e4ea5b6d24e54e5e6375a71dca65d254f7a3e956)*)*
* The separator of the event details output in Discord can be configured administratively for each community. *(commit:* [*e2f67f1c*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e2f67f1c79fd6a1a4bb66ef4f206d4d19245705e)*)*
* Event details, squads and slots can be re-sorted during creation and editing. Note: Slots within a squad are sorted by their numbers when saved. The easiest way to do this is to select "Renumber" after manually sorting. The area in which an element can be sorted is visually highlighted. *(commit:* [*e67672d3*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/e67672d3a7f734e0a971bd80d5bd4d5ab7c24505)*,* [*a60308b1*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/a60308b1e86268b454863d1319d192b403a459f8)*)*
* Squads and slots can be duplicated via the burger menu. In addition to the names and slot numbers, the rules (reservation and blocking) are also copied. *(commit:* [*596449dd*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/596449dd42ecf614aa339be6819b52d3cc5bd141)*)*
* During event creation and editing, the date is displayed in the format of the browser language. *(commit:* [*52b3120e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/52b3120e0b19a40756e519a743e10bc6785f5433)*)*
* For setting the SteamId, adjusting the event notifications, activating and deactivating the external calendar and setting the communities, the success, error message, loading status and general validation and performance have been revised. This means that changes to the saved state can always be sent and displayed. *(commit:* [*52b3120e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/52b3120e0b19a40756e519a743e10bc6785f5433)*)*
* Some colour and distance adjustments. Performance and better usability with zoom levels of the browser also directly included. Everything should feel a bit more rounded. *(commit:* [*52b3120e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/52b3120e0b19a40756e519a743e10bc6785f5433)*)*
* On small screens, the event type colour is hidden in the calendar so that the time and the beginning of the event name are more visible. *(commit:* [*9fa7eab9*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/9fa7eab94c9085c70646062e9f24aeee8f1a2f5b)*)*
* Colours of the event types can be copied in the community settings by clicking on the colour. The colour shown is also displayed when hovering. *(commit:* [*9fa7eab9*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/9fa7eab94c9085c70646062e9f24aeee8f1a2f5b)*)*

## üêû Bug Fixes

* Translations may also be empty. As a result, the time in 12-hour format is no longer displayed with am/pm and oClock in the event details. *(commit:* [*95901b6e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/95901b6ec9c0f1e860c32d409fa6f942015a1ae6)*)*
* In addition to general technical improvements in the editing of events, changes to be saved during event editing are recognised more reliably. In addition, further changes are possible even after the first save and event details can be cleared. *(commit:* [*c3989a95*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/c3989a959edff82c40a4a7716bf009d6180d687e)*,* [*19faab6d*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/19faab6db9f59587b57cc110bab532bdc3735fce)*,* [*f5a357c2*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/f5a357c2b8b732dc5f93b455eec6858d84cfccac)*,* [*e908ce9a*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e908ce9a4bdf42f4d598973a359b93aa40133882)*)*
* If a player unslots from an event within one minute, notifications for the start of the event are still sent in certain constellations. `(Thanks M√§xo and Gaik for testing)` *(commit:* [*c9880db7*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/c9880db7ba80fc5a498ec3ac375574ac1402d336)*)*
* The search function can also be used to switch between guilds. *(commit:* [*52b3120e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/52b3120e0b19a40756e519a743e10bc6785f5433)*)*
* Switching from a community in which I am authorised to make settings to a community in which I am not authorised, no longer displays an error toast. *(commit:* [*52b3120e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/52b3120e0b19a40756e519a743e10bc6785f5433)*)*

## üî® Technical

* If an unexpected error should occur during a reply to a Discord Slash Command, it will now be displayed with a clear error message. *(commit:* [*8ba3b650*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/8ba3b6505b9598120bc1f379771ec4a667ea0ad5)*)*
