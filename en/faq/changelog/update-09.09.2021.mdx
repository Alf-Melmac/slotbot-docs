* Fixed an incorrect configuration that prevented events from being saved with the new description size. `(Thanks M√§xo for tracking down this error)`
* The event date could not be changed if the new date specified a day that was not present in the old month. *(commit:* [*30927b45*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/30927b4598c86f3b2a2ec7f7abc02676370df875)*)*
* mission.sqm Upload `(Thanks to Parrot for providing his mission files)`
* A group without a group name prevented the entire upload. *(commit:* [*e1f53627*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/e1f53627e59e76e4c0d1434e2118d6026d56dd6f)*)*
* Leading blanks in a slot name caused the slot number to be transferred incorrectly. *(commit:* [*38781d82*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/38781d82482374510127711765520b34017e9429)*)*
