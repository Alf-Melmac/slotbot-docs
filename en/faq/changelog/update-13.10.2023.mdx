## ‚≠ê New Features

* The [communities](https://slotbot.de/guilds) are now directly accessible from any page. But only if your screen is big enough. *(commit:* [*dd3a9677*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/dd3a9677d4e9ee114b2b8fdabf847f57a84a77b8)*)*
* New page with information about the expired login session. For example, if the same user has logged in too many times, or if their roles have changed. *(commit:* [*8a0b0008*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/8a0b0008d54041d519fe0e2b683590b388f7495c)*,* [*b1b991af*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/b1b991afe9e87067880a66b2f9862c51e75956f8)*)*
* Community role management *(commit:* [*6068afb4*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/6068afb4eb0776099f5ab99de95f7e7e876d0520)*,* [*2672d254*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbot-frontend/commit/2672d254bb5ea0578684187042a283d4c653508f)*,* [*335af06b*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/335af06b47abf15780bbb45c6a155efbd09dd1c3)*,* [*eaa78d81*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/eaa78d819b829677097188d589e173463696e9d9)*,* [*9a985c72*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/9a985c72298f5321000dd0f7581ceb8b11fca0ba)*)*
* Permissions no longer need to be managed entirely through Discord roles. This also removes the need for the auto-generated Slotbot\_Admin and Slotbot\_Event\_Manage roles. On servers where these roles have already been created, they will not be removed automatically.
* Community administrators can grant community members the right to edit events and the community. Roles can also be synced with Discord roles.
* Community members are automatically removed when they leave the linked Discord server. *(commit:* [*04ac047e*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/04ac047ee4361fa7fda82709948b0223e7a35305)*)*
* With the new image upload, images can now be easily uploaded to events instead of having to insert a link. *(commit:* [*31cdeecc*](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/commit/31cdeecc7b2721119b32567905e14b855876d691)*)*
* This change is in preparation for the upcoming change for Discord links, which can no longer be used indefinitely outside the app: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16zs1gt/cdndiscordapp_links_will_expire_breaking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16zs1gt/cdndiscordapp_links_will_expire_breaking/)
