# Event calendar

The focus of planning is based on events. These are planned sessions for which potential attendees are able to sign up.

The event calendar provides a calendar overview of all past and already planned future events. Colour codes allow you to quickly distinguish between different types of events.

![You can use the mouse to view details such as number of attendees and duration of the event by pointing at the event](../.gitbook/assets/Slotbot-Calendar.png)

Clicking on an event opens the [event-details.md](event-details.md "mention").
