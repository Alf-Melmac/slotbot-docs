In addition to duplication and deletion, other rules can be configured using the three-dot menu behind each line.

### Reservation

Entire squads or individual slots can be reserved for specific communities. Only members of the selected groups will be able to register for these slots. Reservations for squads are inherited by slots.

### Lock

Slots may also be locked. This prevents registrations for that slot. It will be displayed in the slot list as either 'Gesperrt' or the selected replacement text. This can also be used to mark registrations from people who do not have a Discord account. See also the command [Block slot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/block-slot).
