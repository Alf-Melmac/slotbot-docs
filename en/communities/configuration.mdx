## Discord Integration

### Language

Not all integrations allow the user to choose their preferred language. For static text, such as the details of an event in Discord, a language can be set.

The following settings can only be configured once the bot has joined the server.

### Archive Channel

Once an event has finished, information about it can be collected in an archive channel.

### Synchronisation Of Member Roles

The three authorisation roles can be linked to Discord roles. When a new role is assigned to a person, the corresponding Discord role is assigned automatically. The reverse also applies: if the linked Discord role is assigned, the corresponding authorisation role is automatically updated.

<Info>
	Only roles below the Slotbot integration role can be selected. You can adjust the order of the roles in Discord, in the Server Settings menu, under 'Roles'.

<Tip>
	Tip: If you configure Discord roles, also configure them for the [slash commands](/en/integrations/discord/recommended-configuration).

## Event types

All available event types are listed here. The types marked as "Global" are pre-defined standards. All others are private to your community.
