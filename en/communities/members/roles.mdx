title: "Roles"

Every new community member is assigned the 'Member' role by default. In addition, there are two further authorisation levels. These roles determine the extent of members' access to and control over content.

Access rights increase progressively as you move up the list of roles. We start with the lowest level of access and work our way up.

  <Accordion title="Member">
	  This is the standard role for every new member. With this role, you can register for community-reserved slots in events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Planner">
	  Event planners are essentially administrators for events. They can create and edit events for the community.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Admin">
	  Administrators can configure all aspects of the community. They can decide who is added or removed from the community and also make [configuration](/en/communities/configuration) changes.
