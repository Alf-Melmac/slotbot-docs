title: "Add or remove members"

Currently, members can only be added via Discord. This can be done automatically via roles or manually using the context menu.

## Synchronization of roles

Once the [configuration has been made in the community settings](/en/communities/configuration#synchronisation-of-member-roles), the permissions of members are updated automatically when Discord roles are added or removed. If a member role has been configured, users are added to it automatically when they receive it.

## Add a member manually

Members can be added to a community manually at any time via Discord: [Add Community](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/add-community)

## Remove members

Community administrators can remove individual members at any time via the [members](/en/communities/members) overview page.

Once a member role has been configured, members are automatically removed from the community if they lose the matching Discord role, or one of the higher authorization levels.

Members who leave the community's Discord server automatically lose their membership status.
