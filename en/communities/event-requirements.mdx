![Requirements overview](/images/communities/event-voraussetzungen/Guild-Requirements.png)
With **Event Requirements**, you define the conditions that participants must fulfil to join certain events. This could be a specific DLC, completed training, or other criteria.

You decide whether members manage their requirements themselves or whether this is handled by community administrators.

<Info>
	**Permissions**

	To create and manage requirements, the `Admin` role is required.

## How requirements work
- Event creators [select requirements from the slotlist](/en/events/creating-events/slotlist-rules#requirements) that have been enabled for the respective event type.
- Multiple requirements are **AND-linked**: participants must fulfil **all** selected requirements to be able to register.

## Creating requirements
Open the [Community Administration](/en/communities/configuration) and scroll to the **Requirements** section.

Requirements are organised in lists so you can group related criteria together.

### List settings

For each list, you define two properties in addition to the name:

#### 1. Who manages the fulfilment status?
- **Self-assignment allowed (participants themselves)**: Participants indicate which requirements they fulfil when registering. This is saved and remembered for next time.
- **Community Administrators**: Admins manage fulfilment in the [member management](/en/communities/members/manage-members#fulfilled-requirements).

#### 2. Mandatory or just a hint?
- **Mandatory (Blocker)**: If one of these requirements is missing, registration is blocked. (Not every requirement needs to be fulfilled, only those selected for the slot.)
- **Not mandatory (Hint)**: Participants only receive a hint but can still register.

### Requirements: Name, abbreviation and icon

Each requirement needs at least a **name**.

Optionally, you can provide an **abbreviation**. This is used in places with limited space, for example in the Discord output of the slotlist.

**Icons** make requirements recognisable at a glance. You can optionally upload a second icon for light backgrounds.

## Using requirements in events

To give event creators a clear selection to choose from, you enable requirement lists specifically for certain event types.

Stay in the Community Administration and switch to the **Event Types** heading. Select an event type and click the <Icon icon="list-check"/> icon in the row.

Subsequently, all requirements from the enabled lists are available for selection in events of this type. Event creators can select individual or all requirements from these.
