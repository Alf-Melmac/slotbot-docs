Event detail standards are like templates for events. They remind the event creator of important information to communicate to participants.

Suggestions can be free text, free text with selection options, or yes/no selections. All of these can be pre-filled optionally.

After selecting the event type, event creators can then simply use this template in the event [details](/en/events/creating-events#details).
