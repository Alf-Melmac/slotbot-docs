There is already an event, the first participants are registering …

## Register

### Person on Discord

The command [Force slot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/force-slot) allows a person with the role `Slotbot_Event_Manage` to enter a Discord user. The command accepts either the person itself (`@Name`) or the user id ([Discord Support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/de/articles/206346498-Wie-finde-ich-meine-Server-ID-) to get the user id).

Or even better, the participant simply registers him/herself [Slot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/slot)!

<Info>
	To move a person to a different slot, simply enter the new slot number. The old slot will automatically be released.

### Other Persons/Placeholders/Block Slots

Using the command [Block slot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/block-slot), any free text can be antered at a slot. This will prevent anyone from registering for that slot.

## Deregister

### Sign out person, remove placeholder, unlock slot

The assignment of a slot in an event can be cancelled using the command [Force unslot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/force-unslot). It does not matter whether the assignment is to a person or if it is just a placeholder text (blocked slot).

Each participant can unslot himself/herself at any time using the [Unslot](/en/integrations/discord/bot-commands/unslot) command.
