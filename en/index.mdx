<h2 className={"text-primary dark:text-primary-light"}>Focus on the event, we'll take care of the rest.</h2>

We want to help **communities focus on** the content of their **events** by providing a simple yet powerful platform for organising events.

Our goal is to create an **event-based**, **easy-to-use** and **collaborative** product that allows participants and event planners to share all relevant information.

To ensure that as many people as possible register, the registration process has been made as easy as possible for users. The event planners are also asked for all the important information in three short steps, so that no questions are left unanswered.
