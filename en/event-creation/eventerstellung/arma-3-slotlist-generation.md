# Arma 3 Slotlist Generation

It is possible to upload the slot list created in Arma 3 in order to have the slot list generated automatically.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Slotbot-MissionSqmUpload.gif)

To do this, save the mission in the Arma 3 editor and make sure that "binarise scenario file" is unchecked. After that, the `mission.sqm` to be uploaded in the Event Wizard will be located in the mission folder. This folder is located under `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arma 3` -> `missions` or `mpmissions`.
